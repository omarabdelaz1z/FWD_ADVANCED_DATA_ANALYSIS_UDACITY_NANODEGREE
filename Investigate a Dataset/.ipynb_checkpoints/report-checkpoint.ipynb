    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project, I decided to choose TMDb movies dataset. The dataset is collected from TMDb API and contains various information about 10,000 movies including many features such as cast members, genre of the movie, budget, revenue and more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Limitations/Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cast members are split by pipe **\"|\",** so it makes much effort to select a certain actor to check the most favorable actor loved by people.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The same thing applies to genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many occurrences of bad encoding in two columns **cast** and **movie title**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values in movies' budget and revenue are considered limitation of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I have dealt with many questions were I needn't deal with such problems stated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are the questions were came into my mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 1. What is The Most Rated Movie per Year\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 2. Top Five Most Popular Directors Based On Movie Rating Count\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 3. Top Movies for Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 4. The longest movie in terms of runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 5. What production companies that people watch their movies the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 6. What kind of movies that the most production company produce?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 7. Most Favorable/Loved Movie Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### 8. Do Movie Budget Increase Among The Years?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### And this is my approach to investigate the questions respectively.\n",
    "##### 1. I grouped the movies by their release year, then selected the highest vote average for a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "![most_rated_movie_per_year](https://i.imgur.com/PuD1ctQ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Movies are grouped by the movie director then aggregated the number of people votes by summing this number and reach the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top_five_directors](https://i.imgur.com/TcMmgLI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.  I selected each director of the two and retrieved top 3 movies based on the highest average rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 4. I selected  the movie where the the maximum runtime of all movies is that movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "![most-movie](https://i.imgur.com/8Is38UM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. I grouped the data by production companies that have the most vote counts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 6. We can see that people love super hero movies produced by Marvel Studios.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Removed Duplicates - \"Tekken Movie\"\n",
